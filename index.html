              <h2>Summary</h2>

              I like to learn and I have been studying all my life. I studied SMM, Design for Instagram,
              Sales Management, painting. I like to make something by hands, when you create something nice from
              nothing.Programming is also the way to do it.

              I graduated from university with a degree in software engineering but I have not worked in this specialty
              for many years. I have decided to update my knowledge and I have to start from the very beginning. Modern
              technologies change very quickly.

              I want to become an experienced Front-End developer and I try to acquire all the necessary knowledge from
              all possible sources. I have been studying at the Code Institute for 6 months where I have done three
              study projects. Now I have joined the RS school to get profound knowledge of JavaScript.
