## Summary

I like to learn and I have been studying all my life. I studied SMM, Design for Instagram, Sales Management, painting. I like to make something by hands, when you create something from nothing. Programming is also the way to do it.

I graduated from university with a degree in software engineering, but I have not worked in this specialty for many years. I have decided to update my knowledge and I have to start from the very beginning. Modern technologies change very quickly.

I want to become an experienced Front-End developer and I try to acquire all the necessary knowledge from all possible sources. I have been studying at the Code Institute for 6 months where I have done three study projects. Now I have joined the RS school to get profound knowledge of JavaScript.
